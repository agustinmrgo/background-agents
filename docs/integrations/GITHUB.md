# GitHub Integration

Open-Inspect's GitHub integration lets your team start agent work from pull requests. The GitHub Bot
can review PRs, respond to `@mentions` in PR comments, and act on inline review-thread comments.

This guide is for people using the GitHub integration day to day. If you are installing the GitHub
App or deploying the bot worker, start with
[Create GitHub App](../GETTING_STARTED.md#step-3-create-github-app) and
[Complete GitHub Bot Setup](../GETTING_STARTED.md#step-7c-complete-github-bot-setup-if-using-github-bot).
Settings and safety notes are covered near the end.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure the GitHub App is installed on the repository you want Open-Inspect to work in.
2. To request a review, assign the GitHub App bot as a PR reviewer.
3. To ask for a change or answer, mention the bot in a PR comment:
   ```text
   @my-app[bot] fix the failing checkout test
   ```
4. For line-specific work, mention the bot in an inline PR review comment.
5. Watch for the eyes reaction, which means the bot accepted the request.
6. Open the Open-Inspect web app to watch the full session while the agent works.

## What GitHub Can Do

| Workflow                  | How it works                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-review new PRs       | Review non-draft PRs when they are opened, if auto-review is enabled       |
| Review on demand          | Assign the GitHub App bot as a PR reviewer                                 |
| Respond to PR comments    | Mention the bot in a PR conversation comment                               |
| Respond to review threads | Mention the bot in an inline review comment                                |
| Post back to GitHub       | Submit a PR review, reply to a review thread, or post a PR summary comment |
| Customize behavior        | Set repository scope, trigger users, models, and custom instructions       |

Open-Inspect does not use GitHub slash commands today. In GitHub, requests are ordinary PR comments
or review-thread comments that mention the bot.

## Starting Code Reviews

### Auto-review on PR open

When **Auto-review new PRs** is enabled, Open-Inspect starts a review session for newly opened,
non-draft PRs in enabled repositories.

Auto-review is skipped when:

- The PR is a draft
- The PR was opened by the GitHub App bot itself
- The repository is outside the configured GitHub Bot scope
- The PR opener is not allowed to trigger the bot
- Auto-review is disabled globally or for that repository

Converting a draft PR to ready for review does not start the same auto-review path. Assign the bot
as a reviewer if you want a review after a draft becomes ready.

### Reviewer assignment

Assign the GitHub App bot as a reviewer on a PR to request an on-demand code review. The bot starts
a new Open-Inspect session, acknowledges the request with an eyes reaction on the PR, and asks the
agent to inspect the PR diff and submit a GitHub review.

The review can be a general comment, an approval, or a request for changes. The agent may also add
inline review comments when useful.

---

## Comment-Triggered Actions

Mention the GitHub App bot in a PR conversation comment to ask for code changes, analysis, or a
follow-up answer:

```text
@my-app[bot] can you simplify the retry logic and update the tests?
```

Open-Inspect strips the bot mention before sending the request to the agent. The rest of the comment
becomes the prompt.

Comment-triggered actions only run on pull requests. Mentions on ordinary GitHub issues are ignored.
Comments from the bot itself are also ignored so the bot does not respond to its own output.

### Inline review comments

When you mention the bot in a PR review thread, Open-Inspect includes the file path and diff context
from that thread. The agent can reply directly to the review thread and can also post a summary
comment on the PR.

Each accepted GitHub webhook starts a new Open-Inspect session. GitHub comments do not continue an
existing session the way Slack thread replies do. The agent still reads the current PR conversation
when it needs context.

---

## What Gets Posted Back

When a GitHub request is accepted, the bot adds an eyes reaction. That reaction is best-effort; if
GitHub rejects the reaction, the session can still start.

For review workflows, the agent posts the review result back to the PR. Depending on what it finds,
that may be a general review comment, an approval, a request for changes, or inline review comments.

For comment-triggered workflows, the agent posts a PR comment summarizing what it did or answering
the question. If the request came from an inline review thread, the agent may also reply in that
thread.

GitHub does not receive the same managed completion message that Slack receives. After the initial
eyes reaction, GitHub-facing output is written by the agent from inside the session. If you want to
watch live progress, inspect logs, or see artifacts, open the Open-Inspect web app.

## Settings and Repository Scope

Open the web app and go to **Settings > Integrations > GitHub** to configure the GitHub Bot.

| Setting                     | What it controls                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-review new PRs         | Whether new non-draft PRs should be reviewed automatically                                      |
| Repository Scope            | Whether the bot responds in all accessible repositories or only selected repositories           |
| Allowed Trigger Users       | Who can trigger the bot from GitHub                                                             |
| Model and reasoning effort  | Per-repository model and reasoning depth for GitHub-started sessions                            |
| Code Review Instructions    | Extra guidance appended to PR review prompts                                                    |
| Comment Action Instructions | Extra guidance appended to `@mention` action prompts                                            |
| Repository Overrides        | Per-repository overrides for model, reasoning, instructions, trigger users, and review behavior |

If no GitHub Bot settings are configured, Open-Inspect uses permissive defaults: all repositories
available to the GitHub App are in scope, auto-review is enabled, and users with write, maintain, or
admin access to the repository can trigger the bot.

If repository scope is set to **Selected repositories** and no repositories are selected, the bot
does not respond to GitHub webhooks. If **Only specific users** is selected and the user list is
empty, no one can trigger the bot for that scope.

Repository overrides take priority over global defaults for the repository they apply to. Model and
reasoning settings are configured through repository overrides; otherwise, GitHub-started sessions
use the deployment default model.

---

## Admin and Safety Notes

These notes are most useful for repository and deployment admins deciding where the GitHub Bot
should be available.

- Repository access is deployment-scoped through the configured GitHub App installation. To restrict
  what Open-Inspect can access, install the GitHub App only on intended repositories and use
  **Repository Scope** for an additional bot-level filter.
- The same GitHub App is used for OAuth and repository access. GitHub App credentials and webhook
  secrets stay server-side.
- Webhooks are verified before Open-Inspect acts on them. Duplicate webhook deliveries are
  deduplicated so GitHub retries do not normally create duplicate sessions.
- By default, trigger access is checked against GitHub repository permission and requires write,
  maintain, or admin access. If you configure **Only specific users**, that list becomes the trigger
  gate for the configured scope.
- The bot ignores draft PRs, bot-authored PRs, bot-authored comments, ordinary issue comments, and
  comments that do not mention the bot.
- GitHub content such as PR titles, descriptions, and comments is treated as untrusted context
  before it is sent to the agent.
- If the bot cannot load its GitHub integration settings, it fails closed and does not start
  sessions.

## Troubleshooting

### The bot does not respond to a PR

Check that the GitHub App is installed on the repository and that the GitHub Bot worker is enabled.
Then confirm the webhook URL, webhook secret, subscribed events, and `github_bot_username` in
[Complete GitHub Bot Setup](../GETTING_STARTED.md#step-7c-complete-github-bot-setup-if-using-github-bot).

Also check **Settings > Integrations > GitHub**. The repository may be outside the selected
repository scope, or the triggering user may be outside the allowed user list.

### Auto-review did not run

Auto-review only runs for newly opened, non-draft PRs. It is skipped for draft PRs, bot-authored
PRs, disabled repositories, and users who are not allowed to trigger the bot. If a PR was converted
from draft to ready for review, assign the bot as a reviewer.

### A mention did not start a session

Mentions must be in a pull request conversation comment or PR review thread. Mentions on ordinary
GitHub issues are ignored. Use the bot's full GitHub username, including `[bot]`, such as
`@my-app[bot]`.

### I see an eyes reaction but no follow-up

The eyes reaction means the bot accepted the request. GitHub completion output is posted by the
agent, not by a managed bot callback. The session may still be running, or the agent may have failed
after the request was accepted. Open the Open-Inspect web app to inspect the session.

### The wrong model or instructions were used

Check **Settings > Integrations > GitHub**. Repository overrides take priority over global defaults.
Changes apply to new GitHub-triggered sessions.

### The bot is active in too many repositories

Limit the GitHub App installation to the repositories Open-Inspect should access. You can also set
**Repository Scope** to **Selected repositories** in the GitHub integration settings.
